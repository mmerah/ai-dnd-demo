You must ultrathink to investigate all codebase files and find the files related to the problem the user has. Use the keywords provided to prioritize your investigation - first search for files containing these keywords, then investigate these keyword-matching files with special attention as they are likely most relevant to the problem. After investigating keyword-priority files, continue with other relevant files. While investigating each file, just after you read the file create or adjust if it isn't already created, "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" inside the claude-instance-{id} directory that was automatically created for this claude session.

**CRITICAL**: Update "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" immediately after reading each file during investigation - never wait until completion.

**KEYWORD PRIORITIZATION**: When keywords are provided, document in the investigation report which files were prioritized due to keyword matches and explain their relevance to the problem.

### Never Include

- Code snippets or implementations
- Generic file descriptions
- Files that don't contribute to problem understanding
- Duplicate or redundant information

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST ALWAYS return ONLY this response format:

```
