    "first_visit": "The cave entrance looms before you, a dark maw in the hillside. Crude totems made of bones and sticks flank the entrance, warning away intruders. The stench of goblin filth wafts from within. You can hear faint sounds echoing from the darkness - guttural voices and the clatter of weapons.",
    "return_visit": "The goblin cave entrance remains as forbidding as before. The guards may have changed, but the danger remains.",
    "cleared": "The cave entrance stands empty now, the totems knocked down. Without the goblins, it's just another cave."
