    "first_visit": "You push open the heavy wooden door of the Rusty Tankard Tavern. The warm glow of the fireplace greets you, along with the comforting smell of ale and roasted meat. Several patrons sit at worn wooden tables, their conversations creating a low murmur. Behind the bar, a stout man with a graying beard wipes down mugs.",
    "return_visit": "The familiar warmth of the Rusty Tankard welcomes you back. The same fireplace crackles, and Tom the barkeep gives you a knowing nod.",
    "cleared": "The tavern feels more lively now that the goblin threat has been dealt with. Patrons laugh more freely, and even Tom seems more relaxed."
